Project and Apps


Project
To create a project in django we do the following:
    $ django-admin startproject mysite

Apps
To create an app inside a project we do the following:
    $ python manage.py startapp polls


What’s the difference between a project and an app? 
An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. 
A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. 
A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.


Create a new Project Steps:
1. $ python manage.py startapp polls
2. Create a new views.py file if not available and from django.http import HttpResponse
3. Define your index
    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse('Hello Silcharians, welcome to django')

4. Create a urls.py file and import your view.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index')
    ]

Add the url patterns in the app/urls.py

5. Add the path in your project(mysite)/urls.py
    path('silchar/', include('polls.urls'))
    
6. Run the project and redirect to the page


Adding multiple pages under the same application

1. In your views.py
    add a new function which returns a new page
    
    def homepageSilchar(request):
        return HttpResponse('This is the homepage of silcharians')

2. Add the function in the urlpatterns of your urls.py of the application
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        path('home', views.homepageSilchar, name='homepage')
    ]

3. Restart the server and redirect to the silchar/home
